## Landing Page Performance
A small number of landing pages generate the majority of leads. Specifically, only 125 out of 495 landing pages (25.3%) are classified as high-traffic pages, as they brought in 10 or more leads. Despite their small proportion, these high-traffic pages accounted for 90.9% of total leads and 92.3% of total wins.

## Origin Performance
Organic search, social, and paid search are the top lead sources, contributing 71.6% of total leads and 66% of total wins. Organic search led with 28.7% of leads and 32.2% of wins, followed by social (23.1% of leads, 10.7% of wins) and paid search (19.8% of leads, 23.2% of wins). Leads from unknown origins accounted for 14.5% but contributed 22.9% of wins, making them a significant conversion source.
Winning a lead is significantly associated with its origin, as confirmed by the chi-square test (p < 0.05). However, Cramer's V indicates a weak to moderate association. Adjusted residuals show that paid and organic search performed better than expected, while social underperformed. The win rate chart also reflects these trends, with unknown and paid search showing the highest conversion rates.
