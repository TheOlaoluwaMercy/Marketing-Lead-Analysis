## Landing Page Performance
A small number of landing pages generate the majority of leads. Specifically, only 125 out of 495 landing pages (25.3%) are classified as high-traffic pages, as they brought in 10 or more leads. Despite their small proportion, these high-traffic pages accounted for 90.9% of total leads and 92.3% of total wins.

## Origin Performance
Organic search, social, and paid search are the top lead sources, contributing 71.6% of total leads and 66% of total wins. Organic search led with 28.7% of leads and 32.2% of wins, followed by social (23.1% of leads, 10.7% of wins) and paid search (19.8% of leads, 23.2% of wins). Leads from unknown origins accounted for 14.5% but contributed 22.9% of wins, making them a significant conversion source.
Winning a lead is significantly associated with its origin, as confirmed by the chi-square test (p < 0.05). However, Cramer's V indicates a weak to moderate association. Adjusted residuals show that paid and organic search performed better than expected, while social underperformed. The win rate chart also reflects these trends, with unknown and paid search showing the highest conversion rates.

## Recommendations
1. **Test and Optimize High-Traffic Landing Pages**: High-traffic landing pages should be integrated as a pilot rollout across company channels and origins, with A/B testing used to assess their impact on conversion rates. If the results indicate a positive effect, a full-scale implementation can follow.

2. **Analyze and Improve Landing Pages**: A detailed analysis should be conducted on both high-performing and low-performing landing pages to identify key features driving success or failure. A/B testing can be implemented to validate findings. Successful elements from high-traffic landing pages should be replicated in other pages.

3. **Investigate the 'Unknown' Lead Origin**: The unknown lead origin, which shows a strong win rate, should be further analyzed to determine its exact sources and channels. Understanding this will help harness its potential for future lead generation strategies.

4. **Improve Social Lead Performance**: Social leads have a low win rate, warranting an investigation into the target audience of social promotions. Are the promotions reaching potential clients? Audience profiling should be done using data from previously won clients to refine targeting strategies and improve conversion rates.

5. **Enhance Referral Effectiveness**: The referral framework should be reassessed and optimized to make it more appealing, ensuring that it drives higher engagement and conversions. Incentives and messaging should be tailored based on insights from successful referrals.
